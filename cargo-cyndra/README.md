  -h, --help                                   Print help
  -V, --version                                Print version
```

### Subcommand: `init`

To initialize a cyndra project with boilerplates, run `cargo cyndra init [OPTIONS] [PATH]`.

Currently, `cargo cyndra init` supports the following frameworks:

- `--actix-web`: for [actix web](https://actix.rs/) framework
- `--axum`: for [axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) framework
- `--poem`: for [poem](https://github.com/poem-web/poem) framework
- `--poise`: for [poise](https://github.com/serenity-rs/poise) discord bot framework
- `--rocket`: for [rocket](https://rocket.rs/) framework
- `--salvo`: for [salvo](https://salvo.rs/) framework
- `--serenity`: for [serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) discord bot framework
- `--thruster`: for [thruster](https://github.com/thruster-rs/Thruster) framework
- `--tide`: for [tide](https://github.com/http-rs/tide) framework
- `--tower`: for [tower](https://github.com/tower-rs/tower) library
- `--warp`: for [warp](https://github.com/seanmonstar/warp) framework

For example, running the following command will initialize a project for [rocket](https://rocket.rs/):

```sh
cargo cyndra init --rocket my-rocket-app
```

This should generate the following dependency in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
rocket = "0.5.0-rc.2"
cyndra-rocket = { version = "0.16.0" }
cyndra-runtime = { version = "0.16.0" }
tokio = { version = "1.26.0" }
```

The following boilerplate code should be generated into `src/lib.rs`:

```rust
#[macro_use]
extern crate rocket;

#[get("/")]
fn index() -> &'static str {
    "Hello, world!"
}

#[cyndra_runtime::main]
async fn rocket() -> cyndra_rocket::CyndraRocket {
    let rocket = rocket::build().mount("/", routes![index]);

    Ok(rocket.into())
}
```

### Subcommand: `run`

To run the cyndra project locally, use the following command:

```sh
# Inside your cyndra project
cargo cyndra run
```

This will compile your cyndra project and start it on the default port `8000`. Test it by:

```sh
$ curl http://localhost:8000
Hello, world!
```

### Subcommand: `login`

Use `cargo cyndra login` inside your cyndra project to generate an API key for the cyndra platform:

```sh
# Inside a cyndra project
cargo cyndra login
```

This should automatically open a browser window with an auto-generated API key for your project. Simply copy-paste the API key back in your terminal or run the following command to complete login:

```sh
cargo cyndra login --api-key <your-api-key-from-browser>
```

### Subcommand: `deploy`

To deploy your cyndra project to the cloud, run:

```sh
cargo cyndra project start
cargo cyndra deploy
```

Your service will immediately be available at `{crate_name}.cyndraapp.rs`. For instance:

```sh
$ curl https://my-rocket-app.cyndraapp.rs
Hello, world!
```

### Subcommand: `status`

Check the status of your deployed cyndra project with:

```sh
cargo cyndra status
```

### Subcommand: `logs`

Check the logs of your deployed cyndra project with:

```sh
cargo cyndra logs
```

### Subcommand: `stop`

Once you are done with a deployment, you can stop it by running:

```sh
cargo cyndra stop
```

Thanks for using `cargo-cyndra`! We’re very happy to have you with us!

During our alpha period, API keys are completely free and you can deploy as many services as you want.

Just keep in mind that there may be some kinks that require us to take all deployments down once in a while. In certain circumstances we may also have to delete all the data associated with those deployments.

To contribute to `cargo-cyndra` or stay updated with our development, please [open an issue, discussion or PR on Github](https://github.com/cyndra-hq/cyndra) and [join our Discord](https://discord.gg/H33rRDTm3p)! 🚀
