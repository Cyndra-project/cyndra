# Service Integrations

The list of supported frameworks for cyndra is always growing. If you feel we are missing a framework you would like, then feel to create a feature request for your desired framework.

## Writing your own service integration

Creating your own service integration is quite simple. You only need to implement the [`Service`](https://docs.rs/cyndra-service/latest/cyndra_service/trait.Service.html) trait for your framework.
