# Cyndra Secrets

This plugin manages secrets on [cyndra](https://www.cyndra.rs).

## Usage

Add `cyndra-secrets` to the dependencies for your service, and add a `Secrets.toml` to the root of your project
with the secrets you'd like to store. Make sure to add `Secrets.toml` to a `.gitignore` to omit your secrets from version control.

Next, pass `#[cyndra_secrets::Secrets] secret_store: SecretStore` as an argument to your `cyndra_service::main` function.
`SecretStore::get` can now be called to retrieve your API keys and other secrets at runtime.

An example using the Rocket framework can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/cyndra-hq/cyndra-examples/tree/main/rocket/secrets)
